# BoJanglesPetStoreSQL
This repository contains the SQL code for creating multiple tables including appointment, customer, and employee details.

The repository also contains SQL queries that report relevant insights to the BoJangles Pet Store. I added a ERD diagram made with LucidChart to help show each table and their relationship.
